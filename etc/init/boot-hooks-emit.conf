# boot-hooks-emit - Triggers boot hooks
# This job is used to trigger a variety of hooks at boot time on Touch devices

# It does that through the "boot-hooks" event and the WHEN variable.
# That variable can be "every-boot" or "new-version".
# In the latter case, it's accompanied by two other variables,
# OLD_BUILD and NEW_BUILD each containing a build ID.
